# Chemtools

This is a collection of miscellaneous scripts and programs I wrote. Mostly TeraChem job creation and output processing stuff.

# Table of Contents

1. autotc: Scripts to create many parameter-varied tc jobs, and an (optional) barebones process scheduler.
2. fft: A wrapper for DFT. Does pre-processing (window, mirror, etc.), plotting, and has some other bells and whistles.

The fft script has options to perform the FT using the method of Pade approximants. Credit to [jjgoings for the original code](https://github.com/jjgoings/pade) and the authors of the original paper:
